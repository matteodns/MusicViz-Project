# MusicViz-Project

Project of Data-Visualization for an Ecole Polytechnique course (CSC_51052_EP).

## Data

The chosen dataset explores 15000 music tracks over a large timespan (since the 1920s), and some of their characteristics, alongside some geographical data.

Two Kaggle datasets were used : 
- [15,000 Music Tracks - 19 Genres (w/ Spotify Data)] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thebumpkin/10400-classic-hits-10-genres-1923-to-2023/data) for temporal and general data
- [Favorite Music Genres by Country] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalll3302/favorite-music-genres-by-country) for geographical data
